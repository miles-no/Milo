# Computer and Mobile Equipment Guidelines and Ordering Procedures

## Equipment Selection and Replacement

To ensure efficiency in your daily work, you are responsible for selecting a computer and mobile device that meet your professional needs. If you require additional equipment, feel free to inquire, as various options are available in the office.

### Expected Lifespan

- **Computers**: 3 years
- **Mobile devices**: 2 years

Devices will only be replaced when necessary, meaning they must be defective or no longer suitable for work. If a device becomes damaged before reaching its expected lifespan, check whether it can be repaired or replaced under warranty.

### Early Replacement & Damage Reporting

- Notify the administration if you require a new device before the expected lifespan expires.
- In case of damage, verify if the insurance policy covers repairs or replacement.
